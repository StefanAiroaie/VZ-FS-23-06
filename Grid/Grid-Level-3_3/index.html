            <h3>Shattering cookware</h3>
            <p>Lacerations caused by knives of all kinds (not just the kitchen type) affected more than 350,000
                people
                in 2012, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Dull knives are actually more
                dangerous
                than sharp ones, because they require more pressure to use and their worn edge can cause the knife
                to
                slip off food and into your fingers.</p>

            <h3>Shattering cookware</h3>
            <p>The oven is magic. No longer do we have to sear our food on an open fire like our ancestors did; we
                have
                a nifty box that keeps the heat contained and cooks our food to perfection. But all that heat
                combined
                with metal components and cookware leads to loads of burns. Quick tips (which are obvious, but good
                to
                keep in mind): Always use oven mitts, replace them when they’re old; don’t use a wet towel as an
                oven
                mitt; don’t reach your arm in to check baked goods, pull out the rack to test;</p>
